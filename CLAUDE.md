# Project Guidelines

## Slide Modifications

**IMPORTANT:** All slide-related requests MUST be handled using the appropriate specialized agent:

- **slidev-generator**: Use for creating new slides, editing slide content, modifying layouts, or any changes to `.md` slide files
- **slide-reviewer**: Use for reviewing slides, providing feedback on design/clarity/engagement, or analyzing presentation quality

Never modify slide files directly. Always delegate to these agents for any slide work.
